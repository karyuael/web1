        I picture something,
        it's beautiful
        It's full of life, and it is all blue
        I see a sunset on the beach, yeah
        It makes me feel calm
        When I'm calm, I feel good

        And when I feel good, I sing
        And the joy it brings
        makes me feel good
        And when I feel good, I sing
        Of the joy it brings me
        I see birds fly across the sky
        everyone's heart flies together
        Yea food is fryin and people smiling
        Like there is no other way
        to feel good

        And when I feel good, I sing
        And the joy it brings
        makes me feel good
        Cos when I feel good, I sing
        and the joy it brings

        I say come on along
        I know you really wanna
        feel our song
        We've got some life to bring
        We've got some joy in this thing
        Come on along
        I know you really wanna
        feel our song
        We've got some life to bring
        We've got some joy in this thing

        I say come on along
        I know you really wanna
        feel our song
        We've got some life to bring
        We've got some joy in this thing
        Come on along
        I know you really wanna
        feel our song
        We've got some life to bring
        We've got some joy in this thing

        Can you feel
        Can you feel
        Can you feel the joy that it brings
        If you can feel the joy you then should let yourself sing
