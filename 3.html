        Maybe I annoy you with my choices

        you annoy me sometimes too with your voice

        But that ain‘t enough for me

        To move out and move on

        I‘m just gonna love you like the woman I love



        We don‘t have to hurry

        You can take as long as you want

        I‘m holding steady

        My hearts at home

        With my hand behind you

        I will catch you if you fall

        Im just gonna love you like the woman I love


        Sometimes the world can make you feel

        Youre not welcome anymore



        And you beat yourself up

        You let yourself getting mad

        And in those times when you stop lovin

        That woman I adore

        You could relax

        Because, babe, I got your back

        I got you



        I dont wish to change you

        Youve got it under control

        You wake up each day different

        Another reason for me to keep holding on

        Im not attached to any way youre showing up

        Im just gonna love you like the woman I love

        Yeah Im gonna love you

        oh Yeah Im gonna love

        Youre the woman I love
