    <p>
        If this life is one act
        Why do we lay all these traps
        We put them right in our path
        When we just wanna be free
    </p>
    <p>
        I will not waste my days
        Making up all kinds of ways
        To worry about all the things
        That will not happen to me
    </p>

    <p>So I just let go of what I know I don't know
        And I know I'll only do this by
        Living in the moment
        living my life
        Easy and breezy
        With peace in my mind
        With peace in my heart
        Peace in my soul
        Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
        Living in the moment
    </p>

    <p>I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
        I let my past go past
        And now I'm having more fun
        I'm letting go of the thoughts
        That do not make me strong
        And I believe this way can be the same for everyone
    </p>

    <p>And if I fall asleep
        I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
        To live in the moment
        to keep my life
        Easy and breezy
        With peace in my mind
        I got peace in my heart
        Got peace in my soul
        Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
    </p>

    <p>I can't walk through life facing backwards
        I have tried
        I tried more than once to just make sure
        And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
        But I spun around and hurt no more
        By living in the moment
        Living my life
        Easy and breezy
        With peace in my mind
        I got peace in my heart
        Got peace in my soul
        Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
    </p>

    <p>I'm living in the moment
        I'm living my life
        Just taking it easy
        With peace in my mind
        I got peace in my heart
        I got peace in my soul
        Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
        I'm living in the moment
        I'm living my life
        Oh, easy and breezy
        With peace in my mind
        I got peace in my heart
        I got peace in my soul
        Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
        I'm living in the moment
    </p>
